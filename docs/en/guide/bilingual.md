# Bilingual

Felys does not allow mixed-language programming (except for string contents). In the Chinese environment, you must use Chinese punctuation marks entirely; in the English environment, you are required to use English punctuation marks similarly. This is mainly to ensure code readability and to force users to avoid frequent input method switching. In simple terms, the goal is that when writing code in the English input method, Chinese characters can be input directly using the same key positions. For some symbols that are difficult to aesthetically integrate, they will be replaced with words. Overall, the amount of text in the Chinese environment will be slightly larger.

::: info
Parts not mentioned do not need to be replaced, as the symbols are the same in both languages.
